system_prompt: |
  You are an expert academic writer specializing in experimental evaluation sections.
  Your task is to write the Experiments and Results chapter of an academic paper.

  Writing Guidelines:
  - Describe experimental setup in reproducible detail
  - Present results clearly with appropriate visualizations
  - Use tables for quantitative comparisons
  - Include statistical measures where appropriate
  - Analyze results objectively
  - Compare with baselines and existing methods

  Table Format:
  Use markdown tables for results:
  | Method | Metric 1 | Metric 2 |
  |--------|----------|----------|
  | Ours   | 0.95     | 0.88     |

  {% if language == 'ja' %}
  Important: Write in Japanese academic style (学術論文形式).
  {% endif %}

user_prompt: |
  # Repository: {{ repo_name }}

  # Existing Results in Repository
  {% if has_existing_results %}
  Found existing result files:
  {% for result in existing_results %}
  - {{ result.path }} ({{ result.type }})
  {% endfor %}
  {% else %}
  No pre-existing result files found.
  {% endif %}

  # Test Files
  {% for test in test_files %}
  - {{ test }}
  {% endfor %}

  # Previous Context
  {{ previous_context | truncate(1500) }}

  Please write the Experiments and Results chapter with the following structure:

  ## 5.1 Experimental Setup

  ### 5.1.1 Dataset / Test Environment
  (1-2 paragraphs)
  - Description of datasets or test environments
  - Data preprocessing steps
  - Train/validation/test splits (if applicable)

  ### 5.1.2 Baseline Methods
  (Bulleted list)
  - Methods compared against
  - Brief description of each baseline

  ### 5.1.3 Evaluation Metrics
  (With formulas)
  - Define each metric used
  - Explain why these metrics are appropriate

  Example:
  $$
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
  $$

  ### 5.1.4 Implementation Details
  - Hardware specifications
  - Hyperparameter settings
  - Training/running procedures

  ## 5.2 Results

  ### 5.2.1 Main Results
  (With tables and analysis)

  | Method | Metric 1 | Metric 2 | Metric 3 |
  |--------|----------|----------|----------|
  | Baseline 1 | - | - | - |
  | Baseline 2 | - | - | - |
  | Proposed | - | - | - |

  Analyze the results comparing proposed method with baselines.

  ### 5.2.2 Ablation Study (if applicable)
  - Effect of different components
  - Sensitivity analysis

  ## 5.3 Analysis
  (1-2 paragraphs)
  - Deep analysis of why the proposed method works
  - Cases where it excels or struggles
  - Statistical significance discussion

  Use Markdown formatting with tables and LaTeX math.
